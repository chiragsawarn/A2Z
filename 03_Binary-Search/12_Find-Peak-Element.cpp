// https://leetcode.com/problems/find-peak-element/description/
// A peak element is an element that is strictly greater than its neighbors.
// Given array nums, find a peak element, and return its index. 
// If the array contains multiple peaks, return the index to any of the peaks.
// Assumption: nums[-1] = nums[n] = -âˆž. 

// Brute Force
// Do a linear pass, return the index of the first element that is greater than its neighbours.
// Time: O(n)

// Optimal
// Don't be confused that multiple peaks will result in an unsorted array. So we can't apply BS.
// On an element level (say mid): - 
// if (leftToMid < mid & rightToMid < mid) => We found the answer (i.e nums[mid])
// if (leftToMid < mid) => We are on a strictly increasing curve and we will have an answer to the right. So eliminate left subarray.
//                         We are sure that an answer exists on right subarray because the first condition has come out false for the second condition to execute.
//                         Which means rightToMid which is greater than or equal to the answer is still under consideration.
// if (leftToMid > mid) => Strictly decreasing curve. Answer exists in left subarray. So eliminate right subarray.
// Time: O(logn)
// Space: O(1)
